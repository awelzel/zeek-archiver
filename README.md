# zeek-archiver

A Zeek log archival service.

This tool is derived from
[bro-atomic-rotate](https://github.com/ncsa/bro-atomic-rotate)
and intends to solve the same failings of Zeek's historical log-archival
process: robustness and atomicity.  It's rewritten with two further
requirements in mind:

* Independence from [ZeekControl](https://github.com/zeek/zeekctl).
  It's meant for use in conjunction with the upcoming
  [Zeek Supervisor Framework](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/frameworks/supervisor.html).
* Independence from Python.  In retrospect, it's dubious whether that's
  a benefit: implementing in C++ has little advantage over a solution done in
  a simpler Bash/Python script, so it may get completely rewritten
  later if any concrete maintenance burden/problems are encountered.

## Dependencies

* CMake 3.0 or greater
* C++ compiler with C++17 support (GCC 7+ or Clang 4+)
* By default, compression is enabled by shelling out directly to `gzip`,
  either install that separately or disable/change the compression
  mechanism via the `--compression=` flag.

## Build

Just run `make`, which is short for:

```
$ mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```

## Install

```
$ make install
$ cp zeek-archiver.service /etc/systemd/system/
# Modify the ExecStart invocation in service file as needed.
$ systemctl enable zeek-archiver
$ systemctl start zeek-archiver
```
